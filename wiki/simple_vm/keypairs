#SSH keys and sharing access

##Basic
You need to set up a ssh key pair in your Profile. This key is needed so you can access the virtual machine via ssh. If you want to grant someone
access to your virtual machine you need to share your private ssh key with them. This needs to be done over an encrypted channel, as anyone with your
private ssh key can access your machine. The person you are sending the private key to then needs to use the key with the ssh option -i {name_of_private_key}.

##Multiple key pairs
If you are responsible for multiple machines and only want to share access of some of them it makes sense to create new key pairs for different virtual
machines. If you use multiple keys you need to provide the respective name of the name of the private key with the -i command for ssh. It is also
strongly advised that you create an exclusive ssh key pair for the de.NBI cloud, if you plan on using your ssh key pair for other connections and want
to share your private key.

##Reminder
Please only share the private ssh key with people you trust. Furthermore, you are still responsible for the virtual machine if you share your
access with other people.
