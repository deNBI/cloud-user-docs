## Deploy and configure jenkins and haproxy with JuJu

The following instructions have been used to setup Jenkins and Haproxy using [JuJu](https://jujucharms.com) in the de.NBI Cloud.
It has been tested in the Bielefeld Cloud Compute Center but should be applicable with little modifications on all
de.NBI Cloud compute centers.

## Setup juju client 

First we have to set up the juju client in a VM in OpenStack, so it has full network access to
newly spawned VMs without assigning a floating IP.

```
sudo add-apt-repository -yu ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt install juju
```

### Add cloud config

In the next step we need to configure our cloud setup. Therefore we create the
following config file `cebitec.yaml`:

```yaml
clouds:
  cebitec:
    type: openstack
    auth-types: [ userpass, access-key ]
    regions:
      Bielefeld:
        endpoint: https://openstack.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de:5000/v3/

```
and run

```
juju add-cloud cebitec -f ./cebitec.yaml

```

### Add login credentials

To spawn VMs, juju must be able to login to OpenStack.
So add your credentials in a config file `cebitec-creds.yaml` like this

```yaml
credentials:
  cebitec:
    <credential name (e.g. username)>:
      auth-type: userpass
      username: <username>
      password: <password>
      tenant-name: <project>

```

and add them with

```
juju add-credential cebitec -f ./cebitec-creds.yaml

```

### Add image metadata

In order to use an image, juju needs to create some metadata for it first.
In this example we add the current xenial image.

We create a directory for metadata with the following command:

```
mkdir -p ~/juju/images
```

Now we add metadata for the xenial image

```
juju metadata generate-image -d ~/juju -i febceb9a-fb0f-4f1c-ad06-8caf6340de64 -s xenial -r Bielefeld -u https://openstack.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de:5000/v3/

```

where the image ID in OpenStack has to be specified with the `-i` and the release name (series) with `-s`.

## Deploy the juju controller

Basically, this is just `juju bootstrap`. Because we use private cloud, we have
to specify the location of the image metadata with `--metadata-source`.

```
juju bootstrap --metadata-source ~/juju cebitec

```

If there are multiple networks available for your project, choose the right one
with the `--config network=<network id>` parameter.

## Deploy jenkins and haproxy

After deploying a juju controller it is possible to define a juju model in two yaml files.

- The first file describes the construction of the juju model 

- This model.yaml file creates 1 jenkins machine with docker installed and 1 haproxy machine.

- It also configures ssl termination with the files `ssl.key` and `ssl.crt`. 

```yaml
services:
  jenkins:
    charm: "cs:jenkins"
    num_units: 1
    options:
      password: <passwort>
      install_keys: 0EBFCD88
      install_sources: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial stable
      extra_packages: docker-ce
  haproxy:
    charm: "cs:haproxy"
    num_units: 1
    expose: true
    options:
      ssl_key: include-base64://ssl.key
      ssl_cert: include-base64://ssl.crt
relations:
  - - "jenkins:website"
    - "haproxy:reverseproxy"
``` 

!!! Note
    You can use the charm: ```"cs:~sgiller/jenkins-1"``` (jenkins charm + optional steps)
    if you want to deploy a jenkins charm with docker preinstalled and skip the optional steps.


!!! Note
    Do not forget to set a passwort in the options section of jenkins.<br/>
    Do the Optional steps if you want to use your own charm.
    
To deploy jenkins and haproxy you have to execute the following command:

```BASH
juju deploy model.yaml
```


The second file configures our already deployed haproxy. It sets the exposed port of our setup to 443.

```yaml
- service_name: jenkins
  service_host: "0.0.0.0"
  service_port: 443
  crts: [DEFAULT]
  service_options:
      - balance leastconn
      - reqadd X-Forwarded-Proto:\ https
  server_options: maxconn 100 cookie S{i} check
``` 
to apply this configuration you need to run 

```BASH
juju config haproxy services=@hconfig.yaml
```

All possible options can be found at the charm websites under configuration [haproxy-charm](https://jujucharms.com/haproxy/).

## Run custom commands

It is possible to run custom commands with juju, using the run command:

```BASH
juju run  "<command>"  --machine <machine number>
```

The command below sets the docker group on machine 34:

```BASH
juju run "sudo usermod -aG docker $USER "  --machine  34
```

## Optional steps

### Edit and push existing juju charm
The following chapters will describe how to push a charm to your repository add layers and add the jenkins user to the docker group by default.

### Prerequisite
An [ubuntu one](https://login.ubuntu.com) account is needed to upload your own charm.
```
sudo apt-get install charm
``` 
to install the charm software

### Download charm

Download the charm you want to edit from the charmstore by pressing Download .zip.

Now extract the zip file and open a terminal in the charm folder.

### Edit charm
If you want to add layers (for example [docker-layer](https://jaas.ai/u/lazypower/docker/23)) to the charm you have to add
```includes: ['layer:docker']```  to the other layers in the layer.yaml file. This will install docker+docker-compose to your charm.

!!! Note
    If you add the dockerlayer to your charm you dont need to add the docker-ce installation in your model.yaml


By editing the config.yaml you can adapt the charm description.

### Build charm
After adding a layer to your charm you have to rebuild the charm.

use:
```
charm build
cd builds/<charm-name> 
```
to generate code for the new layer and go into the ```builds/<charm name>``` folder with the terminal.

### Adding jenkins user to dockergroup and test charm
To add the jenkins user by default to the docker group add the import: <br/>
 `from subprocess import check_call `<br/>
at the top and the command: <br/>
 `check_call(['usermod', '-aG', 'docker', 'jenkins'])`<br/>
below the line: users = Users() in the <path to charm>/reactive/jenkins.py file

The charm can be tested by deploying it locally with 
```
juju deploy <path to local charm>
```

### Push charm and grant rights


To push the charm to your repository use:
```
charm push <path to local charm> 
```
It will ask you for your ubuntu one login.

Use:
```
charm grant <charm url> everyone 
```
To make the charm accessible to all users.

Now you can deploy your charm by using the charm url in your model.yaml

### Change MTU for docker

To change the MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit) for docker you have to login on your jenkins Machine with the command (use juju status to get the machine number):

```bash
juju ssh <machine number>
```

and then change the docker MTU with the following command:


```bash
sudo ifconfig docker0 mtu 1440
```

finally use
```bash
exit
```
to log off the machine.
